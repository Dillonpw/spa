# Tech start-up landing page

This landing page is built with Vite, React, and motion.
I wanted to dive into the motion.dev animations and see what i could put togethet without doing too much. Most everything has an initial animation and a few items have animations on hover and click, but i tried to keep them from being jarring or annoying.
